## Getting Started

- Clone

```sh
$ gcl https://github.com/Dev-Siri/Siri-s-NewTab
```

- Install dependencies

```sh
$ pnpm i

# or

$ bun i
```

- Build

```sh
$ pnpm build

# or

$ bun run build
```

- Then go to `chrome://extensions` in the browser
- Turn on developer mode (if not already on)
- Then click on "Load Unpacked" and select the dist folder that was created after the build

You now have a new tab that looks slightly less awful.
